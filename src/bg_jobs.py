"""Background job execution for the agent's `bash` tool.

Long commands (installs, ffmpeg, model downloads) should NOT block the chat
stream — a multi-minute held SSE connection is fragile (model-stops-early,
timeouts, tab suspend). Instead we launch them **detached** and let an
always-on monitor re-invoke the agent when they finish ("auto-continue").

Design goals:
  * Restart-safe: status is derived from an on-disk exit-code file, not a live
    PID, so a uvicorn restart never loses a job or its result.
  * Idempotent follow-up: a job stays {done, followed_up: False} until the
    agent has actually been re-invoked, so completion can never silently
    "do nothing" — the monitor retries on the next tick.
  * Bounded: a hard max-runtime marks a runaway job failed and STILL triggers
    a follow-up ("timed out"), so you always hear back.

This module only owns launch + state. The monitor / agent re-invocation lives
in the caller (so this stays import-light and unit-testable).
